Cognitive biases affect the decision making with the emotions and the amount of information we dispose

1. Action bias
We prefer action instead of inaction (Good performance in all aplications)
2. Heuristic bias 
(thinking with your emotions)
3. Ambiguety bias
We reject information that perceive as ambigous or missing information
4. Anchoring bias
We rely heavily on a first impresion to make an opinion, example: offer a discount in the following format ~~1000~~ $500 50% off 
5. Attentional bias 
(How external factors affect our attention)
6. Availability Heuristic
The availability heuristic describes our tendency to use information that comes to mind quickly and easily when making decisions about the future.
7. Bandwagon effect
Adopting a behavior because the majority does 
8. Barnum effect
When a person believes that generic information apply to them (especially if this information is positive) example: recommendation of youtube and spotify (they just recommending what the majority listens), NOTE: this doesnt work if the information is negative
9. Base rate fallacy
We believe more in a particular case of our environment that in a stadistic
10. Bikeshedding
Focusing more on trivial matters than the important ones
11. Bottom dollar effect
A purchase that exhaust our budgets make us feel bad and unsatisfied with the product (promotions when the people collect his salary)
12. Bounded rationality
When we prefer an option that is good enough instead of the optimal, this can be used to trick the client with afirmations that would require much time or money to investigate (example: cage free eggs)
13. Bundling bias
Whe spend more money if we buy a bundle, even if we dont use the majority of the items in the bundle
14. Bye now effect
We tend to buy more if we read the word bye (only applies to english speakers)
15. Cashless effect
We spend more money with the credit card than if we do with cash, spending with cash is more painful
16. Category Size bias
We believe that an outcome is more posible if it takes part of a larger category (for example believing that in a soccer competition the brazilian or argentinian player is going to win)
17. Choice Overload
When we have too many choices and we feel saturated by that
18. Cognitive disonance
Cognitive dissonance describes when we avoid having conflicting beliefs and attitudes because it makes us feel uncomfortable. The clash is usually dealt with by rejecting, debunking, or avoiding new information.
19. Commitment bias
Commitment bias, also known as the escalation of commitment, describes our tendency to remain committed to our past behaviors, particularly those exhibited publicly, even if they do not have desirable outcomes.
20. Confirmation bias
The confirmation bias describes our underlying tendency to notice, focus on, and give greater credence to evidence that fits with our existing beliefs.
21. Decision Fatigue
Decision fatigue describes how our decision-making gets worse as we make additional choices and our cognitive abilities get worn out. Decision fatigue is the reason we feel overwhelmed when we have too many choices to make.
22. Declinism
Declinism is the tendency to see the past in an overly positive light and to view the present or future in an overly negative light, leading us to believe that things are worse than they used to be. Declinism is often a feeling harbored about the overall state of a country, society, or institution, with the view that it is in decline or getting worse.
23. Decoy effect
The decoy effect describes how, when we are choosing between two alternatives, the addition of a third, less attractive option (the decoy) can influence our perception of the original two choices. Decoys are “asymmetrically dominated:” they are completely inferior to one option (the target) but only partially inferior to the other (the competitor). For this reason, the decoy effect is sometimes called the “asymmetric dominance effect.”

Imagine you’re lining up at a movie theater to buy some popcorn. You’re not all that hungry, so you think you’ll get a small-sized bag. When you get to the concession stand, you see the small costs $3, the medium is $6.50, and the large is $7. You don’t really need a whole large popcorn, but you end up buying it anyway because it’s a much better deal than the medium. 

In this example of the decoy effect, we can consider the large popcorn as the target that the movie theater wants you to purchase, while the small popcorn is its competitor. By adding the medium popcorn as a decoy (since it is only 50 cents less than the large one), the movie theater persuasively convinces you to give in and make the bigger purchase instead.
24. disposition effect
The disposition effect refers to our tendency to prematurely sell assets that have made financial gains, while holding on to assets that are losing money. We are driven to sell our winning investments in order to ensure a profit, but are averse to selling losing investments in hopes of turning them into gains.
25. Distinction bias
Distinction bias describes how, in decision-making, we tend to overvalue the differences between two options when we examine them together. Conversely, we consider these differences to be less important when we evaluate the options separately.
26. Dunning–Kruger Effect
The Dunning-Kruger effect effect occurs when a person’s lack of knowledge and skills in a certain area cause them to overestimate their own competence. By contrast, this effect also causes those who excel in a given area to think the task is simple for everyone, and underestimate their relative abilities as well.
27. Empathy Gap
The empathy gap describes our tendency to underestimate the influence of varying mental states on our own behavior and make decisions that only satisfy our current emotion, feeling, or state of being.
28. Endowment Effect
The endowment effect describes how people tend to value items that they own more highly than they would if they did not belong to them. This means that sellers often try to charge more for an item than it would cost elsewhere.
29. Extrinsic Incentive bias
The extrinsic incentive bias relates to the tendency to attribute other people’s motives to extrinsic incentives, such as job security or high wages, rather than intrinsic ones, such as learning new things or building a new skill.
30. Framing Effect
The framing effect is when our decisions are influenced by the way information is presented. Equivalent information can be more or less attractive depending on what features are highlighted.

Consider the following hypothetical: John is shopping for disinfectant wipes at his local pharmacy. He sees several options, but two containers of wipes are on sale. One is called “Bleachox” and the other is called “Bleach-it.”

Both of the disinfectant wipes Jon is considering are the same price and contain the same number of wipes. The only difference Jon notices, is that the Bleachox wipes claim to “kill 95% of all germs,” whereas the “Bleach-it” wipes say: “only 5% of germs survive.” After comparing the two, John chooses the Bleachox wipes. He doesn’t like the sound of germs ‘surviving’ on his kitchen counter.

John’s decision to buy the Bleachox over Bleach-it wipes was informed by the framing effect. Although both products were equally effective at fighting germs, and essentially claimed the same thing, their claims were framed differently. Bleachox highlighted the percentage of germs it did kill (a positive attribute), whereas Bleach-it highlighted how many germs it did not kill (a negative attribute).
31. Functional Fixedness
Functional fixedness is a cognitive bias that impacts an individual’s ability to be creative. Functional fixedness is commonly used to describe why an individual develops an inability to use an object in more ways than it is traditionally intended to be used, as function fixedness impairs their creativity. Functional fixedness is a phenomenon found in problem-solving psychology and affects an individual’s ability to innovate and be creative when solving challenges.
32. fundamental attribution error
The fundamental attribution error (FAE) describes how, when making judgments about people’s behavior, we often overemphasize dispositional factors and downplay situational ones.5 In other words, we believe that people’s personality traits have more influence on their actions, compared to the other factors outside of their control.
33. Gambler’s fallacy
The gambler’s fallacy describes our belief that the probability of a random event occurring in the future is influenced by previous instances of that type of event.
34. Google effect
The Google effect, also known as digital amnesia, is the tendency to forget information that is readily available through search engines like Google. We do not commit this information to our memory because we know that this information is easy to access online.
35. Halo effect
The halo effect is a cognitive bias that claims that positive impressions of people, brands, and products in one area positively influence our feelings in another area.
36. The Hard-easy effect
The hard-easy effect, also known as the discriminability effect or the difficulty effect, occurs when we incorrectly predict our ability to complete tasks depending on their level of difficulty. It suggests that we are overly confident in how successful we will be at hard tasks and under-confident about how successful we will be at easy ones. 
37. Heuristics
Heuristics are mental shortcuts that can facilitate problem-solving and probability judgments. These strategies are generalizations, or rules-of-thumb, that reduce cognitive load. They can be effective for making immediate judgments, however, they often result in irrational or inaccurate conclusions.

The scarcity heuristic, which refers to how we value items more when they are limited, can be used to the advantage of businesses looking to increase sales. Research has shown that advertising objects as “limited quantity” increases consumers' competitiveness and their intentions to buy the item.
38. Hindsight Bias
The hindsight bias is our tendency to look back at an unpredictable event and think it was easily predictable. It is also called the ‘knew-it-all-along’ effect.
39. Hot-hand fallacy
The hot-hand fallacy is the tendency to believe that someone who has been successful in a task or activity is more likely to be successful again in further attempts. The hot-hand fallacy derives from the saying that athletes have “hot hands” when they repeatedly score, causing people to believe that they are on a streak and will continue to have successful outcomes.
40. Hyperbolic Discounting
Hyperbolic discounting is our inclination to choose immediate rewards over rewards that come later in the future, even when these immediate rewards are smaller.
41. IKEA effect 
The IKEA effect, named after everyone’s favorite Swedish furniture giant, describes how people tend to value an object more if they make (or assemble) it themselves. More broadly, the IKEA effect speaks to how we tend to like things more if we’ve expended effort to create them.
42. Identifiable Victim effect
The identifiable victim effect describes the likelihood that we feel greater empathy, and an urge to help, in situations where tragedies are about a specific, identifiable individual, compared to situations where the victims are a larger, vaguer group of people.
43. Illusion of control
The illusion of control describes how we believe we have greater control over events than we actually do. Even when something is a matter of random chance, we often feel like we’re able to influence it in some way.
44. Illusion of Validity
The illusion of validity is a cognitive bias that describes our tendency to be overconfident in the accuracy of our judgements, specifically in our interpretations and predictions regarding a given data set.
45. Illusory Correlation
Illusory Correlation is when we see an association between two variables (events, actions, ideas, etc.) when they aren’t actually associated.
46. The Illusory Truth effect
The illusory truth effect, also known as the illusion of truth, describes how, when we hear the same false information repeated again and again, we often come to believe it is true. Troublingly, this even happens when people should know better—that is, when people initially know that the misinformation is false.
47. In-group bias
In-group Bias (also known as in-group favoritism) is the tendency for people to give preferential treatment to others who belong to the same group that they do. This bias shows up even when people are put into groups randomly, making group membership effectively meaningless.
48. Incentivization
Incentivization is attaching a reward to a given behavior, or threatening a penalty for failing to do that behavior. In some cases, incentives are powerful tools to motivate people to take a certain action. Other times, however, incentives can backfire, and might decrease motivation instead of increasing it.
49. Just-World Hypothesis
The just-world hypothesis refers to our belief that the world is fair, and consequently, that the moral standings of our actions will determine our outcomes. This viewpoint causes us to believe that those who do good will be rewarded, and those who exhibit negative behaviors will be punished.
50. Lag Effect
The lag effect suggests that we retain information better when there are longer breaks between repeated presentations of that information.
51. Law of the Instrument
According to the law of the instrument, when we acquire a new skill, we tend to see opportunities to use it everywhere. This bias is also known as “the law of the hammer”, “the golden hammer”, or “Maslow’s hammer”, in reference to psychologist Abraham Maslow’s famous quote: “I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail”1.
52. Less-is-better effect
The Less-is-better Effect describes how people sometimes prefer the worse of two options, but only when the options are presented separately. When people consider both their choices together, their preferences reverse, so that the less-is-better effect disappears.
53. Leveling and Sharpening
Leveling and sharpening are concepts that have been introduced by early Gestalt psychologists as memory distortions that occurs when we fail to remember details of a certain memory. In psychology, leveling occur when some details are lost or it can also happen when we want to tone down certain moment.
54. Levels of Processing effect
The levels of processing effect is based on the idea that the way in which information is encoded affects how well it is remembered. The levels of processing model counters the idea that mere repetition helps us retain information long-term. Instead, it suggests that information that is encoded on a deeper level, through meaningful association, is easier to remember.
55. Look-elsewhere Effect
The Look-elsewhere Effect describes how, when scientists analyze the results of their experiments, results that are apparently statistically significant might actually have arisen by chance. One reason why this might happen is that a researcher has ignored a statistically insignificant result that they found previously, choosing to “look elsewhere”—continuing to search for a significant finding instead of accepting their initial results.
56. loss aversion
Loss aversion is a cognitive bias that describes why, for individuals, the pain of losing is psychologically twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. The loss felt from money, or any other valuable object, can feel worse than gaining that same thing.1 Loss aversion refers to an individual’s tendency to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. Simply put, it’s better not to lose $20, than to find $20.
57. Mental Accounting
Mental accounting explains how we tend to assign subjective value to our money, usually in ways that violate basic economic principles.1 Although money has consistent, objective value, the way we go about spending it is often subject to different rules, depending on how we earned the money, how we intend to use it, and how it makes us feel.
58. Mere Exposure effect
The mere exposure effect describes our tendency to develop preferences for things simply because we are familiar with them. For this reason, it is also known as the familiarity principle.
59. Motivating-Uncertainty effect
We often find ourselves to be more motivated by rewards of unknown magnitudes than by known rewards because the uncertainty makes it feel like a game. However, this effect, which is known as the motivating uncertainty effect, only occurs when we focus on the journey towards the reward and not when we focus on actually winning the reward.
60. Naive Allocation
Naive allocation, otherwise known as naive diversification, or the diversification bias, refers to our tendency to equally divide our resources among the options available to us, regardless of whether the options themselves can be considered equal.
61. Naive Realism
Naive realism is the tendency to believe our perception of the world reflects it exactly as it is, unbiased and unfiltered. We don’t think our emotions, past experiences, or cultural identity affect the way we perceive the world and thus believe others see it in the same way as we do. Naive realism rests on the idea that there is a material, objective world accessible to us and others around us.1

Naive realism is within the egocentric bias category, a group of biases that indicate we rely too heavily on our own point of view and fail to understand that it is a personal point of view. These biases make it difficult for us to understand other people’s perspectives and can lead to arguments and polarization.
62. Negativity Bias
The negativity bias is a cognitive bias that results in adverse events having a more significant impact on our psychological state than positive events. Negativity bias occurs even when adverse events and positive events are of the same magnitude, meaning we feel negative events more intensely.
63. Noble Edge effect
When companies demonstrate social responsibility that is perceived as genuine by consumers, they are rewarded with increased respect, which in turn leads to greater profits. That’s the noble edge effect.
64. Nostalgia effect
Feelings of nostalgia, or sentimentality for days gone by, lead us to place increased value on social connectedness and less value on saving money. Nostalgia’s influence over our willingness to spend money is referred to as the nostalgia effect.
65. Observer Expectancy Effect
The observer expectancy effect, also known as the experimenter expectancy effect, refers to how the perceived expectations of an observer can influence the people being observed. This term is usually used in the context of research, to describe how the presence of a researcher can influence the behavior of participants in their study.
66. Omission Bias
The omission bias refers to our tendency to judge harmful actions as worse than harmful inactions, even if they result in similar consequences.
67. Optimism Bias
The optimism bias refers to our tendency to overestimate our likelihood of experiencing positive events and underestimate our likelihood of experiencing negative events.
68. Ostrich effect
The ostrich effect, also known as the ostrich problem, is a cognitive bias that describes how people often avoid negative information, including feedback that could help them monitor their goal progress. Instead of dealing with the situation, we bury our heads in the sand, like ostriches. This avoidance can often make things worse, incurring costs that we might not have had to pay if we had faced things head-on.
69. Overjustification effect
The overjustification effect effect describes our tendency to become less intrinsically motivated to partake in an activity that we used to enjoy when offered an external incentive such as money or a reward.
70. The peak-end rule 
The peak-end rule is a psychological heuristic that changes the way we recall past events. We remember a memory or judge an experience based on how they felt at the peak moments, as well as how they felt at the end.
71. Pessimism bias 
The pessimism bias refers to the tendency to overestimate the likelihood of negative events while underestimating the likelihood of positive events. This attitude of expecting the worst is a prominent cognitive feature of depression and can have considerable ramifications on both a personal and societal level.
72. Planning Fallacy
The planning fallacy describes our tendency to underestimate the amount of time it will take to complete a task, as well as the costs and risks associated with that task—even if it contradicts our experiences.
73. Primacy Effect
The primacy effect is the tendency to remember the first piece of information we encounter better than information presented later on.
74. Priming
Priming, or, the priming effect, occurs when an individual’s exposure to a certain stimulus influences their response to a subsequent prompt, without any awareness of the connection. These stimuli are often related to words or images that people see during their day-to-day lives
75. Projection bias
The projection bias is a self-forecasting error, where we overestimate how much our future selves will share the same beliefs, values and behaviors as our current selves, causing us to make short-sighted decisions.
76. Reactive devaluation
Reactive devaluation refers to our tendency to disparage proposals made by another party, especially if this party is viewed as negative or antagonistic. This cognitive bias can serve as a major barrier in negotiations.
77. Regret aversion
Regret aversion occurs when a decision is made to avoid regretting an alternative decision in the future. Regret can be a powerless and discomforting state and people sometimes make decisions in order to avoid this outcome.
78. Representativeness Heuristic
The representativeness heuristic is a mental shortcut that we use when estimating probabilities. When we’re trying to assess how likely a certain event is, we often make our decision by assessing how similar it is to an existing mental prototype.
79. Response bias
The response bias refers to our tendency to provide inaccurate, or even false, answers to self-report questions, such as those asked on surveys or in structured interviews.
80. Restraint Bias
The restraint bias refers to our tendency to overestimate the level of control we have over our impulsive behaviors. These urges typically come from “visceral impulses” such as hunger, drug cravings, fatigue, or sexual arousal.
81. Rosy Retrospection
Rosy retrospection refers to our tendency to recall the past more fondly than the present, all else being equal. It is a cognitive bias that runs parallel with the concept of nostalgia, though the latter does not always directly imply a biased recollection. The phrase stems from the English idiom, “rose-tinted glasses,” where people see things as better than they were.
82. Salience bias 
The salience biasdescribes our tendency to focus on items or information that are more noteworthy while ignoring those that do not grab our attention.
83. Self-serving bias
The self-serving bias describes when we attribute positive events and successes to our own character or actions, but blame negative results to external factors unrelated to our character. The self-serving bias is a common cognitive bias that has fascinated researchers globally for decades.
84. The Serial Position effect
The serial position effect describes how our memory is affected by the position of information in a sequence. It suggests that we best remember the first and last items in a series and find it hard to remember the middle items.
85. Sexual Overperception bias
The sexual overperception bias relates to the tendency to overperceive another individual’s sexual interest in oneself. The bias predominantly occurs in men, where they are more likely to overestimate a woman’s sexual interest while women are more likely to underestimate a man’s.
86. Social Norms
Social norms are collectively held beliefs about what kind of behavior is appropriate in a given situation. They range from specific customs—for example, the Western custom of shaking hands with somebody when you meet them for the first time—to more general rules that govern behavior and influence our understanding of other people.
87. Source Confusion
Source confusion, also know as source misattribution or unconscious transference, is a type of memory error. It occurs when someone does not remember where certain memories come from.
88. Spacing Effect
The spacing effect demonstrates that learning is more effective when repeated in spaced-out sessions. By repeating and spacing out information individuals learn, they can better recall that information in the future.
89. Spotlight Effect
The spotlight effect describes how people tend to believe that others are paying more attention to them than they actually are—in other words, our tendency to always feel like we are “in the spotlight.” This bias shows up frequently in our day-to-day lives, both in positive situations (like when we nail a presentation and overestimate how impressed all our co-workers must be) and in negative ones (like when we bomb the presentation and feel like everybody must be laughing about it behind our backs).
90. Status Quo bias
The status quo bias describes our preference for the current state of affairs, resulting in resistance to change.
91. Suggestibility
Suggestibility refers to how susceptible we are to altering our behavior based on the suggestions of others.
92. Survivorship bias
Survivorship bias is a cognitive shortcut that occurs when a successful subgroup is mistaken as the entire group, due to the invisibility of the failure subgroup. The bias’ name comes from the error an individual makes when a data set only considers the “surviving” observations, excluding points that didn’t survive.
93. Take-the-best Heuristic 
The take-the-best heuristic is a shortcut we use when making decisions between alternatives, so that we can quickly make decisions without having to know all the information about each alternative.

When we employ the take-the-best heuristic, we decide based on only one cue or characteristic which we think differentiates the options.1 Instead of considering all the reasons why we might choose one alternative over the other, we pick one reason and base our decision solely on that reason.

94. Telescoping Effect
The telescoping effect refers to inaccurate perceptions regarding time, where people see recent events as more remote than they are (backward telescoping), and remote events as more recent (forward telescoping). This mental error in memory can occur whenever we make temporal assumptions regarding past events.
95. The Illusion of Explanatory Depth
The illusion of explanatory depth (IOED) describes our belief that we understand more about the world than we actually do. It is often not until we are asked to actually explain a concept that we come face to face with our limited understanding of it.
96. Pygmalion Effect 
The Pygmalion effect describes situations where someone’s high expectations improves our behavior and therefore our performance in a given area. It suggests that we do better when more is expected of us.
97. The Sunk Cost Fallacy
The Sunk Cost Fallacy describes our tendency to follow through on an endeavor if we have already invested time, effort, or money into it, whether or not the current costs outweigh the benefits.
98. Zero Risk Bias
Zero risk bias relates to our preference for absolute certainty. We tend to opt for situations where we can completely eliminate risk, seeking solace in the figure of 0%, over alternatives that may actually offer greater risk reduction.
