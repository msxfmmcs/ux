1. You cant make mistakes in the launch of an app because the first impression its very important (anchoring bias)

2. Dont overwhelm the user with too much information, only tell what is necesary

3. Use the correct decision making model
    - Compensatory model: in this model the user consider all available options weighing pros and cons, in this model its useful make filters, comparisions and detailed information (this model is a good idea for financial apps for example)
    - Non Compensatory model: here is favored the fast decision making, so dont overwhelm the user with information, make comparisions having in mind a single atribute, or put a limit in a single atribute, Remember to highlight the most important atribute
    - Satisficing Model: User takes the first available options that meets a criteria (use top choices or recomendations)

4. Present information progressively (tooltips, expanding sections, labels)

5. Cognitive aids for remember things (notifications, visuel cues to get user attention)

6. Give the user feedback about his decision (loading bars, messages, notifications)

7. use Smart defaults like pre-filled forms and sugested options
